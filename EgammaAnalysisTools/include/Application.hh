// Set the application you want:
// 
//   1 = Likelihood analysis
//   2 = Pdfs Maker from Z tag and probe
//   3 = compare Pdfs in MC and data sPlots
//   4 = supercluster + MET studies for GSF tracking efficiency measurement
//   5 = sPlots 
//   6 = PF electron seeding efficiency study
//   7 = PF electron seeding efficiency study (on general tracks)
//   8 = Z->ee tag and probe
//   9 = measure turn on curve
//  10 = do the selection for the Fake Electron
//  11 = do the selection for the Wenu/Wmunu + Fake Electron
//  12 = do the selection for the Zll + fake electron
//  13 = MC only: take electrons from HZZ->4l
//  14 = measure turn on curve for photons
